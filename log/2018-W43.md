# 2018 Week 43

## How to Pitch zells

I spent the three days that I was working this week (two I was traveling) at the [Web3 Summit]. Since my current budget wouldn't allow me to buy a ticket, I was very happy to get one sponsored by the [Web3 Foundation]. I don't think I've ever been to a conference that I didn't speak at and I got quite worried that I would miserably fail at networking without that advantage. But at the same time I was very grateful for the ticket so I forced myself to use it as an opportunity to develop and test a new "pitch" for zells.

I found a great article about [how to pitch an idea] which I read on my way to the conference and realized that I couldn't even answer the "basic questions". Together with the feedback from last week's seminar, this really got me thinking and I slowly warmed up to the idea, that I might have really been running in the wrong direction since August, probably because of my vanity and/or ego. In a way, I made the classic mistake (that I always tell everyone to avoid) of assuming that I know what the problem actually is. But the first step *must* be to test this assumption.

So I decided that my project should not be to build a better software platform. That's just what my ego wants to do. My project should be to find out what makes programming difficult and how to make it easier. The nice thing is that this yields two very actionable tasks: talk to people about what makes programming difficult for them, and find literature about research of this topic.

But first I would test my new pitch. I set myself the goal of presenting it to 5 people on Monday and since I reached that, increased it to 10 people for Tuesday. My first lesson was that approaching random people and just talk to them is a lot harder than I thought - even at a conference where you're pretty much expected to do that. It's also more time consuming and exhausting than I thought. But since the talks were too low-level for me to understand anything, I had plenty of time and the limited number of people hanging around during the talks made the decision problem easier.

My 5 second pitch was: I'm currently an independent researcher, trying to find out what makes programming difficult and how to make it easier.
The 30 second add-on was: My current approach is identifying "accidental complications" and studying software platforms that successfully avoid them. My goal is to design and test a software platform that combines different successful approaches.
And for the 5 minute version, I would talk about specific complications and my ideas of avoiding them like set-up, deployment/sharing, safety, security, segregation, live-ness and so on.

## Reading blogs

The responses were way more positive than with my old pitches (which I kept making up on the spot). Generally, the people I talked to (including 3 from foundations) said that they do recognize the hurdles of programming as a problem but it's not on their agenda. I plan to follow up with the Ethereum Foundation and Protocol Labs.

Apart from talking to people, I spent most of the time going through my large backlog of articles and blogs, including those of Eve's [Chris Granger] and [Jamie Brandon]. Chris hacking together a prototype that just turned into a huge success on Kickstarter is a great story. I wonder if this level of attention that early is a blessing or a curse. Bit still. Built in one week? I couldn't even build anything worthwhile in two months. Makes me feel super slow.

I was even more impressed by the articles on Jamie's blog though. Especially [Pain we forgot] and [Scaling down] felt like I could have written them. And I also thought [Rationally choosing a life] was a great way of approach life. Definitely need to contact that guy. Could probably learn a lot from him.
