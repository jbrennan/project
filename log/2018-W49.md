# 2018 Week 49

This week I didn't find too much zells time. Through [Jason Brennan][playgrounds talk]'s [talk] I discovered "[Playground]" (also "[Computer, Networks and Education][sci_amer_article]") which is "An Object Oriented Simulation System with Agent Rules for Children of All Ages". That's pretty much exactly what I'm currently pitching for. So I'm very glad to have found it but wish I would have found it earlier.

I also started reaching out to teachers to talk with them about my idea of using building and analyzing simulations to teach concept from physics, biology, sociology, economics or other subjects. And I did find a few that agreed to being interviewed by me so now I need to schedule and actually do these. Probably won't happen this year though since December is always the super busy month.
