Thinking about how to form a virtual community that really feels like a community. One thing is having a clear purpose, a common problem to solve. Maybe: How to accelerate software literacy. Or maybe that should be more like a *missing*. The other thing is creating a kind of exclusivity, maybe by stating that members should dedicate at least half of their time towards solving that problem. And of course it would need a good name. One that is clear and precise but not too lurid.

But there should also be a feeling of real community. How can that be created without colocation, maybe even across timezones? Maybe some wax to "bump into" each other and have casual conversations. Seems the easiest way for that would be to create a physical working space. But for some reason that doesn't seem to be the right way. 

That's one thing that strikes me as odd when it comes to Dynamicland. It's so restricted. Only a tiny fraction of people is able to experience it. Because it's a physical space. And pyhsical space is not only expensive, but it also seperates us. But maybe I'm just disappointent that I can't visit it. Either way, I think it's great what they're doing which is why I started donating 5â‚¬ per month today. It's a small contribution but considering that I have trouble financing myself, I thought it's better than nothing.

But still I would prefer a virtual dynamic land. Maybe some day fully immersive virtual reality gear is the normal way of accessing the virtual world but for now we have to make do with those tiny screens and even tinier screens. So for now I wanna think about how you could use that technology to create a communal feeling. The feeling that there are actually people there, although they might be asleep right now.
And of course I'm thinking about how zells might be this space and what properties it would need to have to be it. Some stuff for thought I guess.
