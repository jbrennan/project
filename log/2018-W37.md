# 2018 Week 37

## 2018-09-10

Week four already. A quarter has passed. Shocking. Today I spent the whole day with serialization. The good news is: recursive serialization of containers with only message works (as long as they are not cyclic, which I have to avoid anyways) and is not even that complicated. I ran into a little bug caused by messages being received in a different order than sent. Asynchronous operations do require a new mindset after being used to sequential processing for so long. But I'm sure it's really only a matter of mindset.

The bas news: after I was done I was trying to figure out what the new demo would look like and realized that it doesn't really work with the new model. After a while I wasn't even sure what I want to show anymore.

Another realization: the visualization of Nodes and Channels (the circles and lines) are really only a visual aid. They are not part of the UI. I think I never really made that clear and cause some confusion with it. The real UI is in the Portals only. But I still need the visual aid since the Portals aren't capable enough yet to stand alone.

But it should be possible to use the prototype without the graphical interface. Maybe that's what Marcel means when he talks about how zells is basically a DSL on top of Squeak. It's a way to do computing, with Nodes instead of objects. Trying to figure out what that DSL could look like brought me back to the beginning and how the very simple things like transmitting a single Signal would be done. So kind of a downward spiral which ended in me not even being sure what I want to show in this demo and thinking that I over-complicate everything cause I still don't have anything interesting going.

So yeah, I ended the day a little bit disillusioned. Let's see what tomorrow brings.

### Planning Demo 4

Thought hard about why I felt so lost yesterday and think it's the fact that I still have no UI to show, only the model. So once I managed to forgive myself, I worked on [planning the next demo][notes misc 5]. I decided I wouldn't try to demo a use case since without a UI that doesn't make sense so instead I would focus on the model and protocols.

Once I was happy with the plan, I went through it with the prototype and changed some smaller things that would facilitate the demo. I also spent way to long implementing a silly little visual effect. Don't know why that's always that important to me. Left me less time to write [the script][script demo 4] so I only got half way.

### Message Tracing

Got sidetracked by thinking about how messages could be traced. Since every transmitted signal has a unique ID, it shouldn't be too hard to store which signal ID caused which signals to be sent. My goal is to be able to answer queries like "what happened after I clicked here?" and "why is this line drawn here?" after the fact. I think this would be insanely useful for debugging. A tricky thing would be what happens when receivers are renamed or moved. But I wanted some way of retaining consistent addresses anyways to avoid problems like link rot.

### Dynabook Paper

I also read [Alan Kay's paper on the DynaBook concept] from 1972 ([notes here][notes dynabook paper]), which I found to be an excellent excercise in grounded imagination. In the paper, Alan describes a vision of how the device could be used very much like a movie scene which I thought is a great format. It also overlaps almost completely with my vision for zells. Because we have the hardware, and it's much more powerful than the 8k portable machine that Alan envisioned. But we still don't have the software. Maybe Scratch is really the closest thing we have for now.

The paper also contains a paragraph describing the program model of early Smalltalk.

> [...] both "objects" and "actors" are just different aspets of the notion of *process*. A process has *state* [...]. Using this view "data" is a process which changes "slowly", "function" is a process which changes more rapidly.

which is exactly what I always come back to reading discussions and blog posts. Why bother with static data if you can have living processes?

### Everything should be an application

Incidently, I also read through [Joel Jakubovic's blog][joel blog] today and [found a post][joel polling head state] that he has reached the same conclusion as me after reading Magic Ink.

> A JPEG “file” should actually be an application. Everything should be an application. Meaning: everything should be able to be a “dynamic picture”; nothing should be limited from the outset to any less.

He also writes that security is a major (but unacceptable) reason why this is not the case.
