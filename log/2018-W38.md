### Related Blogs

[17:18] I created a [list of blogs][blogs] of people who either have a similar project or share my philosophy regarding software. Ted Nelson would probably call them "dissenters". I've also added all feeds that Stefan Lesser shared in the "Future Programming" Slack group, but haven't had time yet to look through them.

Side note: I used to get most of my content from Twitter but decided that I should instead follow blogs in hope for higher quality and lower frequency. So I un-followed about half of my accounts on Twitter and use a mobile app (Read for Android) that will notify me about new RSS items instead.

### Future of Coding Podcast

On the morning commute I started with [episode 20] of [Steve's Podcast]. I'd still rather have these interviews in text but it is a very nice way to get to know different people and their projects so I'm very grateful Steve is producing them. In order to reduce the time it takes me to listen to them, I downloaded a player that can increase playback speed which I set now to 120%.

Although one advantage of the audio format is that I can easily take [notes][foc20 notes]. Maybe this whole Podcast thing will grow on me eventually.

### Next Use Case

After not having worked on the prototype since last Wednesday, it was quite uplifting to dedicate today to designing the next use case: calculating the sum of 3 and 4. After so far I have only been visualizing the communication model, I'm also excited to finally start on the user interface.

So today I was mostly [planning the use case][3+4 readme], thinking about and [sketching][3+4 notes] a couple of design ideas, and also started with the implementation. I think having spent so much time on fleshing out the model might actually have been worth it since I'm a lot less confused now about the difference between UI and the model.

[16:57] Worked yesterday until late on a little UI control to change a number. Realized I out way too much time into it, including testing its usability and improving it twice after feedback. I'm still only aiming for a demo. So usability does not have to be very high, as long as the user interaction is understandable. Yet still, I kept tweaking it the half hour I had before lunch. 

After lunch in the group seminar, Patrick presented an idea for a study on "liveness" that he would like to conduct. Including discussion it took until three. So I only had two hours left to work on the prototype. And I got stuck thinking about Addresses of Nodes.

I want an Address to be potentially anything. Not only strings but also pictures for example. The only job of an Address is to let a Node decide if Message is meant for it or not. So there is really very little restriction. But I think it still needs to be a first-class citizen since Addresses are quite a special kind of Node. I imagine that they would work like references, forwarding all Messages and therefore transparently behaving like the Node it is the Address of.

In the end I didn't really get anywhere and didn't implement anything new. Felt like I spent these two hours running in circles. Even a short walk around the campus didn't help me out of it. So I'll just let it simmer a bit and take another shot tomorrow.

For the rest of the ride home I'll continue with the podcast that I started yesterday.

[17:24] This morning I decided to simply push my maintenance task to tomorrow and only work on zells the whole day, since I felt especially motivated today and less motivated to do anything else. So my [notes][20180920 notes] today are pretty extensive.

On the morning commute I mostly thought about how the Message Editor is only a tiny step since what I really want is a full browser that lets you navigate through and edit any kind of Node. The Editor as I'm building it now is really just a short cut. I feel like the system needs to be a lot more self-contained to do a more flexible browser. For now you can only edit Messages, not any Node on a Mesh.

I built a first version of an Address Editor yesterday evening and today the Node Editor to edit a Node's value and its Address as well as a really simple one for Containers. So all of this together was a usable Message Editor. But once I started editing a Message to add 3 and 4, I realized something odd.

Most of what follows now probably makes very little sense but I will try to explain my thought process today.

The Message was (in short) `(to:numbers.3, content:(add:3))`. The odd thing is that I'm referring to two numbers in this Message - 3 and 4 - but in two very different ways. Once as an Address `numbers.3` and once as just the value `3`. I thought about but leaving it this way as an oddity of the model but then realized that I have to iron this out, so I went for a walk (and created a file for [walk notes]).

It took me a while to really grok what an Address is and how it's different from a Node in a Message but in the end I think I managed to get it clear at least in my head. Not clear enough to write in down here in two sentences but how I see it is: if we're at a party and I want you to talk to somebody I can either give yout their name (ie Address) or push a clone of them in front of you (Message). In the second case you're not talking to the original person though, only to their clone. And since in the model I can't physically move a Node, the only thing I can do is pass the Address. This means I can't actually send the value `4`, only its Address (`numbers.4`). That's the best I can do explanation-wise for now.

So in the end I cannot even use the Number Editor in which I have already put too much time. That hurts. But I must not submit to the sunk cost fallacy.

Instead it would be all about Addresses so after thinking a bit about the implications of not being able to send numbers but only their addresses and how that would work with fractions and complex numbers, I worked a bit on improving the Address Editor design. My goal is to never require the user to guess something but as much as possible offer contextual options.

But in the end I decided the Address Editor is good enough as it is even if it requires guessing and I would get closer to the use case by implementing the *Transceiver* - a Portal to send and receive Messages, or rather Message Editors. That was quickly done but didn't work since the Nodes still used Strings as Addresses but the Message Editor used arrays. So some refactoring was required but I actually got it working before I had to leave which made me quite happy.

Just like I'm writing these words as the train arrives at my stop.

### Implementing the next Use Case

[18:12] My focus today was fully on [implementing the "3+4" use case][trello 48]. I ended up completely revising the model and also the UI a bit. Everything uses now the array Addresses which are displayed on top to be consistent with the Message Editor where this hopefully helps to improve visual segmentation. I thought I could avoid boxes in boxes there but now I think that's exactly what I have to do.

### Protocol Stack

I also [wrote down some thoughts] on stacked protocols. Currently there are three levels:
- a *Signal* can be anything, as long as it's serializable
- to broadcast a Signal through a *Mesh*, it has to have an `ID` and `payload`
- a *Message* lets you talk to a specific Node by defining `sender`, `receiver`, and `content`

There are also lower levels - like how Signals are encoded and transmitted - and higher levels - like what the content of a Message contains and its meaning.

Since I have very little experience in design communication protocols, this probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense but it helps to think about the different levels of the system. My goal is that it's really easy to implement a Node since you can chose which protocol level you want to support. But I'm not sure how to actually achieve this.
