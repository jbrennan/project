# 2018 Week 42

## 2018-10-15

After a cold disabled me for a couple of days, I spent Monday working on the prototype again. Specifically on implementing a completely Portal-based user interface. So instead of viewing and editing messages with embedded editors like in demo 5, Nodes are now again individually rendered and edited with a Portal for each aspect. Got a Portal to show the parts of a container, a Portal to edit Addresses, and one to edit text values. So more like it was in demo 3 or 4 but with a clearer distinction between the model visualizations and the UI.

The whole thing is now less usable again but closer to the kind of UI model I want to use. So the next step would be to find out how to make it more usable without mudding up the model.

I also integrated the new approach with the model visualization from demo 4 so now I can connect Nodes again with drag-and-drop, including Portals since they are Nodes. I also cleaned up the implementation on the way and am quite happy with the result.

I'm not sure if that's already enough to justify a new demo. It would probably be a remake of demo 3 since the new implementation doesn't really lend itself for a "3+4" use case since the usability is so low.

I apparently forgot to mention that some time last week we extended my visitor status at the HPI until the end of the year and I decided that it's probably also a good time frame to extend my zells time for, which gives me an additional 5 weeks for 18 weeks in total with 8 weeks left.

Only spent a couple of hours on zells today. Mostly preparing the "mid-project status report" I want to give at the group seminar tomorrow.

Thinking about it, it seems to me that I have really achieved very little in these 7-8 weeks. Most successful is maybe my experiment of total transparency by publishing this journal and even my notes. And I have recorded 4 demos but I'm not sure if that counts and an achievement. It's definitely output though. I also have done some research although not very systematically and I do feel like I have a better understanding of the area now but I don't think I'd be able to prove that. I have spent a significant amount of time on refining the model and UI of the prototype and made some progress but way less than I hoped for.

I also want to compare zells to the Actor Model since that was asked for last time and Marcel said again at the Squeak e.V. meeting on Saturday, which I couldn't attend because of my cold and where Marcel showed demo 3. I guess the two models are really quite similar. The biggest difference is that in zells there is no "an Actor can do these three things" and messages are broad-casted. Maybe that part will be more a discussion.

And lastly I want to talk about my plans for the rest of the time, i.e. until the end of the year. I would like to continue working on the prototype and record more demos. Especially I want to explore the "conversational programming" idea and find out what programming would really look like in zells. And maybe I even get to explore "fork/merge-based abstraction" a bit. Another big one that I want to tackle again is funding. I don't think I'll be successful but I want to at least try once more to get any kind of public or private or maybe even crowd-sourced funding. Marcel suggested that I should think about writing a publication but at the moment I have absolutely no clue what that could be about.

Finished the [slide for the group seminar presentation][seminar 3] on the train and gave it after lunch.

The thing that sparked the biggest discussion was why the base model does only have "receive message" but no "send message". I could not explain my way of seeing these two things on different levels of a protocol stack. More importantly, refining the model and UI on such a foundational level was regarded as the wrong approach, since the questions of "why are you doing this?", "what can I do with it?", "how would I work with it?" and most importantly "why would I choose that instead of something else and for what tasks?" are still unanswered.

In other words: I spent all this time trying to build my thing bottom-up and thereby disregarding the top, i.e. the big picture too much. But in order to convince anyone that this is something worth working on, I need to be able to show them my vision. So that was a very important, albeit a little hard to take feedback. Basically I've been going in the wrong direction that whole time. But with the extension, I'm only half-way so it's hopefully not too late to change course.

Today I didn't work on zells but instead assisted another robotic workshop with the HABA Digitalwerkstatt. Seems like I haven't mentioned the last one here since that was on Friday of the skipped week (W40). The workshop was actually great fun although a little exhausting as well since I'm not at all used to being responsible for the learning experience of 26 vocally very active 12-year-olds. But it's definitely something I can see myself doing on a more regular basis. So I'm looking forward to see how this collaboration with further develops.

Today I tried to act on the feedback from Wednesday and think about how to express my vision of zells. I had a surprisingly hard time, fearing that all the time indulging in model-refining made me really lose track of the big picture. But really, I don't think I ever had a good pitch, a good way of describing why I'm working on this project and why anybody would ever be compelled to use it. So this is a very much overdue exercise.

My goal is to write a story that shows who could use zells and how. So for example two kids collaboratively building a simple game. Most importantly, I wanna show what zells would enable that no other software platform currently supports. And I want to show why I think expressing and analyzing ideas using dynamic models is important. So maybe a domain expert would create a model of something to use it in the discussion with a policy maker. Not sure yet how detailed I want to describe these scenarios.

I also watched a talk by Alexander Mei√üner about [Symatem], his personal project of "Reinventing Software". This was very interesting to watch in my current situation, since Alexander - like me - goes into quite some detail describing the core model without really explaining why or how you would use the end product. In that way it was a great mirror which motivated me quite a bit to work out a proper pitch for zells.
