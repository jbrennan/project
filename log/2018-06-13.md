On the way to my second day as visiting researcher. The first one went by quite quickly. But having a plan helped. So what's my plan for today?

- [x] finish the overview paper
- [x] get copies of other papers Patrick suggested
- [x] ask Marcel who I could talk to (Jens, no time -> Tim)
- [x] talk to Tim
- [x] read paper about Star UI
- [x] implement Dish, Text Zell and Scope to change its value
  -> implemented Dish, Zell, and ProtoZell with basic operations, but no Scope

Let's get started with finishing the paper.


### Notes on Live Programming Overview Study [10:20]

- interesting that there are 3 distinct communities
- out of the 3 terms, "live programming" matches my goals the best
- missing applications
	- simulations
	- games development
- all three communities conduct "design science": create and evaluate
  -> guess that's exactly what I want to do

  
### Notes on Designing the Star User Interface [10:50]

- mouse is a "Fitt's Law" device
- start design with the user
- essential step: task analysis
	- who is the user
	- what are their goals
	- what information is used
	- what information is generated
	- what methods are employed
- follow Brook's advice and plan to throw the first one away
- easy and hard
	- contrete - abstract
	- visible - invisible
	- copying - creating
	- choosing - filling in
	- recognizing - generating
	- editing - programming
	- interactive - batch
- design principles
	- familiar user's conceptual model
	- seeing and pointing
	- wysiwyg
	- universal commands
	- consistency
	- simplicity
	- modeless interaction
	- user tailorability

	
### Notes from Talking to Tim [11:30]

- project: GraalVM https://www.graalvm.org/
	- e.g. used instead of JVM by Twitter
- works for Oracle labs on a "University Grant"
	- remote in team
	- goal: performance, tool re-use (e.g. IDE, debugger)
- Tool re-use
	- Chrome debugger protocol
	- VS Code language server for Truffle langs (last week's prsentation by Daniel Stolper)
	- Jupyter important use case
		- plan to patch, then PR
- POLYGLOT!!!
	- JS, Java, C, Ruby, Python, R
	- Jens also has a story about how he couldn't use his Basic programs in Pascal
- common runtime with Objects, invokations are translated
- also working on polyglot: Fabio (poster)
- installing dependencies is difficult
- OS calls are going to OS
	- plan is to virtualize OS => sandbox
- zeitgeist of embracing diversity?


### Prototype Eight [16:32]

I finally started implementing the new prototype. My first goal ([use case one]) is to visually construct and send simple Messages. I feel some kind of urge to build a prototype. Not sure where this comes from. Maybe from watching Ted Nelson's [look-back on his life]. I have this conviction that ideas are really not worth much, but only their execution. So I have a strong urge to execute and let my idea clash with the world as soon as possible.

I started with a `Dish` that can `put: aZell`, `remove: aZell` and most importantly `transmit: aSignal`. A `Zell` know about its `container`, which can be a `Dish` or a `ProtoZell` and can use it to `cloneTo: clonedName` or `destroy` itself.

That should cover the basic operations for [use case one]. Next I need to implement an abstract Scope to provide a user interface to perform these operations. Eventually this should be done via Messages but I don't see harm in implementing it using method calls as a first step. Wanna concentrate on the user experience first.

### Log Timestamps

I realized that putting a whole log entry under a single timestamp makes probably no sense in most cases. Instead, I put several timestamps in places to reflect the development of this entry over time. Not sure if that's helpful.
