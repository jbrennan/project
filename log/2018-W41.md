# 2018 Week 41


## 2018-10-08

Looks like I really skipped over a week. Don't even have a good reason. Sure I was busy with other projects. But really, I just kinda lost motivation for a bit there. So the morning I spent mostly with reloading my thoughts of week 39. Good thing I think through ideas by writing them down.

And apart from [my notes][notes 20181008] I didn't produce any output today. But that's still more than what I produced last week. Turns out figuring out what the UI for the "3+4" use case should look like is pretty tricky indeed. I definitely took a shortcut with my implementation for the last demo and I wanna do it properly now.

Hopefully tomorrow I make some more palpable progress.

I really wanted to implement something to avoid another day of just conceptualizing. So I did a simplified implementation of the model ([sources here][fileout 20181010]) without peer-to-peer connection or serialization of messages. So this implementation is targeted for a single process but still uses a model that would support distributed operation. Going single-process is sufficient for this demo and I feel like I've got enough experience with the distributed one to realize if I'm diverting into a direction that would make distribution difficult. So I make sure all communication between Nodes uses asynchronous Messages, even though they are received directly and without being serialized.

So just to test this out, I created a Display Portal and a Star Node that can draw itself on this display. I also built a Star Portal to change the number of points on the Star. So it's a nice reactive loop of edit and update.

I can't shake the feeling of running in circles though. But my hope is that it's actually an ellipse and with every round I get a little bit closer to my goal. So I'll probably have to orbit a couple of times more.

I also spent a significant amount thinking about representation and meaning. My plan with this project is to give each thing its own representation. But I'm not sure how to consolidate this with context-dependent representations. One the one hand it's nice if a thing has a "natural" form and interactions, but you also want to be able to use a different representation if that better fits your context. Like the way different maps represent the same region.

I thought some more about representation and meaning today and decided that I'm probably not ready yet to solve this riddle but that it's also not necessary for this use case and I can just use specific Portals that render a representation of a Node, instead of the Nodes render themselves on a generic Display, although I will have to tackle that some day.

On the train I started reading the thesis of David Rauch, a master student of the SWA group about Example-based Live Programming called "Babylonian-style Programming: Designing and Implementing an Integration of Live Examples into General-purpose Source Code". I didn't get far but the whole thing is very interesting to me since Example-based live programming is one of my bug goals with zells. My current vision is to use a history of events to illustrate the changes of an entity and portals to inspect them. Probably won't get to work on that any time soon but the more I'm happy about having found a thorough analysis of the problem.

Otherwise I've been busy on the prototype, working on the Portals so they can be pointed at Node Addresses and have Addresses themselves. Next up is the Transceiver Portal that transforms received Messages into Nodes that can be inspected using Portals. So the Container Portal is probably the first I need since a Message is a Container.
