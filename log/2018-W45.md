# 2018 Week 45

[2018-11-16] Still catching up on three weeks of slacking off on journal writing, caused by a motivational dry spell.

So I didn't get much done besides reading a paper on [abstraction in Lively Kernel][lively groups] and [a particle simulation system in Etoys][kedama] with an awesome [demo][kedama demo]. I also started reading "A Small Matter of Programming".

I also spent way more time than I care to admit playing [Universal Paperclips] which felt like an utter waste of time but it also gave me an idea for an "educational" economics game. Basically a world building game (think Cities:Skylines or [Factorio]) where you start with a simple lemon juice stand and end with an international lemon juice enterprise managing millions of lemon trees. But instead of buying automations and tools, you build them yourself with software. For example you write a little program that sends your friend to the supermarket whenever you're almost out of lemons. Or one that predicts the lemon tree market and buys them when they're cheap. You can control everything and there are virtually no limits. The idea is that this could be used in school to teach about all kinds of economics concepts like profit, demand and supply, or fixed vs. variable costs.
