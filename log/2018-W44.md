# 2018 Week 44

[2018-11-16] Seems like I haven't written any journal entries in three weeks. Time to make up for it. Good thing I have my [notes].

Was struggling with keeping motivation up that week. Might explain why I didn't write any journal entries. But I did write some emails and most importantly come up with a new plan with the help of a friend who's working in the grant management department of the German ministry of education and science.

She recommended that I should try to write a proposal for a PhD project, use it to get a supervisor from a university on board (ideally Prof. Hirschfeld) and apply with this for a grant from a foundation.

So my new plan is to 
- find a topic that could count as a PhD-worthy project ("finding out what's wrong with programming and fixing is" probably doesn't)
- read as much as possible on that topic
- find a supervisor
- find potentially interested foundations and apply

Finding and reading literature seemed like the most actionable step so I re-organized my "literature" folder (creating a folder for each publications so I can add notes and other meta-data) and started with Kay's "[Future of Reading]" paper. I also found another [blog article][Systems, not Programs] I really liked.

And I asked Jens and Marcel what they thought about my new plan. Both said that I definitely need to find a very specific hypothesis I want to research. For example "is abstraction be easier to understand and use in an environment that lets you go from the concrete to the abstract?" I also should figure out what methodology would be a good fit. All in all though they both said the plan was not bad nit requiring to get much more specific.
