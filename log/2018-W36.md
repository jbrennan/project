# 2018 Week 36

## 2018-09-03

[16:45] I started listening to [Steve's interview with Glen Chiacchieri][foc-26] on the morning train but only got far enough to know that I wanna hear the rest as well. For some reason, audio is far from my preferred format for this kind of content. It's too linear to navigate around in. The only option seems to be to listen to it from front to end, best without interruption since a recap via skimming is also not possible. But I still wanna know what they're saying. But it's a good activity for the commute.

Today I also started publishing my [notes] in the name of complete transparency. These are really pure stream-of-thought, way more than this log. Writing and drawing my ideas is just my way of working through something. For some reason, hand-writing my thoughts really helps me organizing them. It reached the point where I almost can't think about something without pen and paper - or the digital equivalent of it. I consider the destination more important than the journey but I guess I doesn't hurt to have the latter publicly accessible as well. So that's what these notes are.

And I wrote quite some amount today since a seemingly minor UI problem of not being able to attach two Scopes to the same Container turned out to be a symptom of a deeper problem with the model. So once again, I re-designed it from scratch. What I wanna change now is the way Zells are connected. Currently, the only way to do that is to arrange them in a tree structure using Containers. Instead, I want to try out connecting Zells with unidirectional "Channels" that don't imply structure, just a way to send a Signal from one Zell to another, in the resulting "Mesh". I hope that this will give me more flexible ways of building communication networks and separate the concerns of structure and communication. So I will probably re-do the [Send Message] demo with that new model once I implemented it.

### Magic Ink

[13:24] I started the morning with implementing the revised model but had to go to the dentist and continued "Magic Ink" during the hour I was waiting. I started it yesterday evening after it was mentioned in [Steve's interview with Glen][foc-26] a couple of times. I remembered that if I want to seriously read a technical book/essay I should really take notes. So started doing that [here][magicink-notes]. I'm pretty sure I have read the essay before but I was surprised by how much I did not remember so re-reading these things is definitely worth it. I'll summarize my thoughts in the log once I finished it.

### Future of Coding Interview

I then continued listening to the [Future of Coding] [interview][foc-26] on the train and also took [notes][foc-26 notes] this time. Really should have done that yesterday as well. I wrote those on my phone with this pen I bought on Saturday so they're not very readable. 

In the end I enjoyed listening to the interview more than I thought. Still would have preferred to read it though. I'll sum up my notes with a couple of bullet points.

- Scratch vs. Etoys: Scratch is probably more popular because of a better design and community => importance of design (see "Magic Ink")
- target groups: beginners vs experts
	- improve tools for beginners or experts or both (if possible)?
	- how about scientists? how do they work?
	- how about other domain experts?
- UI vs model: wants to improve programming by improving UI
	- most people work on model
	- most models are OK
- CDG (communication design group): community of several research groups
	- started/organized but not lead by Alan Kay
	- funding for people not projects, no strings attached
	- Bret Victors group: dynamic media
		- developed dozens of prototypes
		- HyperCard in the world
		- Game Jam => Laser Socks (killer app Ã  la "Space War")
- Dynamicland: spin-off from Dynamic Media group of CDG
	- amazing operating system: realtalk
	- funding is hard
	- concern: match between technologies and ideals of lab
		- "What is the tech good for?"
	- left because now less interesting in tech and more in compassion
- guide: "What would happen if my work succeeded widely? Would it make people happier?"
	- Most of modern technology has made "no dent in human happiness"
	- wants to make people happy -> wants to become psycho therapist
	- plans for scaling, eg therapist for organizations

One thing I would like to ask Glen about is his statement that technology has made "no dent in human happiness". I would like to know how he measures happiness and how he came to that conclusion. Maybe I just ask him.

### Model Revision

[17:06] Spent way to much time implementing Channels. For some reason I got confused by the GUI part. I wanted a model that supports graphical interaction with drag-and-drop as well as through Smalltalk. In the processed I re-designed the thing at least a dozen times.

A Channel from sender A to receiver B is now created by picking up a ChannelConnector of A by shift-clicking on it and dropping that into B which simply adds the Connector to the receiver Zell. Channels are alway uni-directional and you can open multiple Channels between two Zells.
This makes it possible to receive the same Signal multiple times which means I might have to add some simple de-duplication unless I ignore that whole case.

Once that finally worked I thought about how now that Zells can connect to other Zells I kinda don't need Scopes anymore. So I'll probably drop them and use "Portals" instead which are interface elements translating between the non-Message-world and the Message-world. So still very similar to Scopes but with the difference that Portals are Zells themselves and aren't "attached to" one. I liked that image but it doesn't work with remote Zells anyways so not loss.

Again this feels like an improvement of the model but only time will tell. My notes to the whole model revision today are [here][model revision notes].
