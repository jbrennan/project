# 2018 Week 36

## 2018-09-03

[16:45] I started listening to [Steve's interview with Glen Chiacchieri][foc-26] on the morning train but only got far enough to know that I wanna hear the rest as well. For some reason, audio is far from my preferred format for this kind of content. It's too linear to navigate around in. The only option seems to be to listen to it from front to end, best without interruption since a recap via skimming is also not possible. But I still wanna know what they're saying. But it's a good activity for the commute.

Today I also started publishing my [notes] in the name of complete transparency. These are really pure stream-of-thought, way more than this log. Writing and drawing my ideas is just my way of working through something. For some reason, hand-writing my thoughts really helps me organizing them. It reached the point where I almost can't think about something without pen and paper - or the digital equivalent of it. I consider the destination more important than the journey but I guess I doesn't hurt to have the latter publicly accessible as well. So that's what these notes are.

And I wrote quite some amount today since a seemingly minor UI problem of not being able to attach two Scopes to the same Container turned out to be a symptom of a deeper problem with the model. So once again, I re-designed it from scratch. What I wanna change now is the way Zells are connected. Currently, the only way to do that is to arrange them in a tree structure using Containers. Instead, I want to try out connecting Zells with unidirectional "Channels" that don't imply structure, just a way to send a Signal from one Zell to another, in the resulting "Mesh". I hope that this will give me more flexible ways of building communication networks and separate the concerns of structure and communication. So I will probably re-do the [Send Message] demo with that new model once I implemented it.

### Magic Ink

[13:24] I started the morning with implementing the revised model but had to go to the dentist and continued "Magic Ink" during the hour I was waiting. I started it yesterday evening after it was mentioned in [Steve's interview with Glen][foc-26] a couple of times. I remembered that if I want to seriously read a technical book/essay I should really take notes. So started doing that [here][magicink-notes]. I'm pretty sure I have read the essay before but I was surprised by how much I did not remember so re-reading these things is definitely worth it. I'll summarize my thoughts in the log once I finished it.

### Future of Coding Interview

I then continued listening to the [Future of Coding] [interview][foc-26] on the train and also took [notes][foc-26 notes] this time. Really should have done that yesterday as well. I wrote those on my phone with this pen I bought on Saturday so they're not very readable. 

In the end I enjoyed listening to the interview more than I thought. Still would have preferred to read it though. I'll sum up my notes with a couple of bullet points.

- Scratch vs. Etoys: Scratch is probably more popular because of a better design and community => importance of design (see "Magic Ink")
- target groups: beginners vs experts
	- improve tools for beginners or experts or both (if possible)?
	- how about scientists? how do they work?
	- how about other domain experts?
- UI vs model: wants to improve programming by improving UI
	- most people work on model
	- most models are OK
- CDG (communication design group): community of several research groups
	- started/organized but not lead by Alan Kay
	- funding for people not projects, no strings attached
	- Bret Victors group: dynamic media
		- developed dozens of prototypes
		- HyperCard in the world
		- Game Jam => Laser Socks (killer app Ã  la "Space War")
- Dynamicland: spin-off from Dynamic Media group of CDG
	- amazing operating system: realtalk
	- funding is hard
	- concern: match between technologies and ideals of lab
		- "What is the tech good for?"
	- left because now less interesting in tech and more in compassion
- guide: "What would happen if my work succeeded widely? Would it make people happier?"
	- Most of modern technology has made "no dent in human happiness"
	- wants to make people happy -> wants to become psycho therapist
	- plans for scaling, eg therapist for organizations

One thing I would like to ask Glen about is his statement that technology has made "no dent in human happiness". I would like to know how he measures happiness and how he came to that conclusion. Maybe I just ask him.

### Model Revision

[17:06] Spent way to much time implementing Channels. For some reason I got confused by the GUI part. I wanted a model that supports graphical interaction with drag-and-drop as well as through Smalltalk. In the processed I re-designed the thing at least a dozen times.

A Channel from sender A to receiver B is now created by picking up a ChannelConnector of A by shift-clicking on it and dropping that into B which simply adds the Connector to the receiver Zell. Channels are alway uni-directional and you can open multiple Channels between two Zells.
This makes it possible to receive the same Signal multiple times which means I might have to add some simple de-duplication unless I ignore that whole case.

Once that finally worked I thought about how now that Zells can connect to other Zells I kinda don't need Scopes anymore. So I'll probably drop them and use "Portals" instead which are interface elements translating between the non-Message-world and the Message-world. So still very similar to Scopes but with the difference that Portals are Zells themselves and aren't "attached to" one. I liked that image but it doesn't work with remote Zells anyways so not loss.

Again this feels like an improvement of the model but only time will tell. My notes to the whole model revision today are [here][model revision notes].

[16:18] Not very happy with my implementation progress today. But in the end I only had about 3 hours time for programming. Still, hoped I would be able to record "Send Message" with the Channel-based model on Friday.

### Magic Ink

I finished re-reading [Magic Ink] and will try to summarize my [notes][magicink-notes].

As mentioned before, it was definitely worth reading it again. Now that I have a better overview over the field, I interpreted many things differently and also realized I remembered some things wrong or incompletely.

All in all I'm very impressed by how Dynamicland seems to be almost a natural consequence of ideas that were written down more than ten years earlier. I wish I had that kind of direction in my work.

For example did I remember the "Interactivity considered harmful" chapter title but forgot that Bret was talking only about **"Information Software"** and not about **"Manipulation Software"**. So the argument is not against interactivity per se but that it should be avoided in information software since "the eye is faster than the hand".

What I also had forgotten was the way he used sentences to configure spoken reminders of the BART widget. It reminded me of Smalltalk in the way parameters were embedded in keywords.

I also wonder if things have changed since the essay was written regarding the position and demand of **"good design"**. In terms of physical devices, I feel like things have improved and it's not just Apple anymore who puts a lot of effort into design. On the software side though, I don't see much improvement during the last ten years. I'll be on the lookout for examples of well designed software. It's also a nice indicator that my recent explorations into the worlds of graphic and industrial design were a good idea.

It's really a shame that most courses and books about software use the word **"interactive" and not "dynamic"**. I was never that aware of the difference between these two concepts but I understand now why it's called "Dynamicland" and not "Interactiveland".

I was delighted to find out that **Shannon** happen to use a very similar vocabulary for his communication theory as I chose for zells. A source sends a *Message* which is *transmitted* as a *Signal* through a uni-directional *Channel* to be *received* by the destination.

Another thing I had completely forgotten about was the part about **"Tools" and "Platforms"**. The job of the tool is to encode information and of the platform to decode it. Two really good points are that a) the platform must be very simple or it can't be implemented correctly (eg HTML, POSIX, IMAP) and b) that the burden must be on the tool to provide something that the platform can easily decode (eg MP3, JPEG). Or in Bret's words:

> The platform must make it *possible* to create information software. The tools must make it *easy*.

The following quote could very well be my mantra: 

> In order for a designer to take full advantage of the medium, a good platform must provide safe access to *everything* that is technologically possible. A platform for information software must offer: inputs from the environment [...], history [...], and the user [...]; computational resources [...]; and unrestricted graphical output. Anything less robs information software of its full potential. The proper way to prevent destructive behavior is a well-designed security model, not arbitrarily amputating the computer's capabilities.

It explains why neither the Web (too complicated and amputated) nor Smalltalk (not secure) are good platforms and therefore why I'm working at zells at all.

I had also forgotten about Bret's example of **Programming by Example**. But it's great to see the origin of many ideas that were present in Bret's many demos. Although I feel like they contain quite a bit less inference than described in the essay.

I also yet have to see a piece of software that does **Context Prediction** well, be it from history or from other software. There still doesn't seem to be a platform that really lets the programs it's running talk to each other. The closest I can think of is probably Android's *Intents*. The first thing that would need to be tackled for such a platform is probably privacy concerns. The data would always have to stay in control of the user. Programs can access it, but not their authors.

And at last, I also very much enjoyed being reminded of Bret's ideas about **Devices of the Future**. I very much agree with him that the sweetspot between portability and readability is probably a book (8-10"). My Yoga Book is a little over 10" and that's pretty portable. But even more portable of course is my phone of 4.5" which I can put in my pocket and therefore *always* carry with me. And it still offers some pretty good readability although. And then there is the laptop form factor with 12-13" and foldable which seems to work better for manipulation, since a holding a book occupies at least one of your hands.

In the end I think there'll always be mutliple devices. In the future maybe even more as they are getting cheaper. Some are very portable, some are great for information (dominantly in 2D) and some are optimized for manipulation (probably dominantly in 3D), but everything should be doable with every device.

### A Short History of Live Programming

I watched a talk (unfortunately I forgot how I found it) by Gilad Bracha titled ["A Short History of Live Programming"][[live talk]. Gilad is working on Newspeak which he says is "an experimental system that changes a lot things from Smalltalk. Hopefully for the better. It's kinda hard since the bar is very high". I was aware of Newspeak but haven't looked into it in a while but this talk my all my spider senses tingling. I was also thrilled to find a demo of programming [Binary Search in newspeak] which made the whole thing only more interesting to me.

The most interesting point to me was in the end where Gilad talks about the [issues with Smalltalk]. From what I understood I'm completely on his side and the three points he talks about is exactly what I'm trying to tackle. Gotta take another look at Newspeak.

### Channels, Nodes, and Mesh

[2018-09-10T08:49] First time I lag behind with the log and it's really a lot harder to remember what I did five days later.

I think I started with replacing Scopes with Portals, which was a more significant change than I anticipated. But dropping Scopes is definitely a good idea since it was a consistent source of confusion and I never liked them neither. A good model-smell was probably that the name never seemed to fit but I also couldn't find a better name.

Another name I got rid of was "Zell", since I also got the feedback multiple times that too much focus on the model might distract rather than help. So instead I have Nodes that are connected through Channels to form a Mesh through which all Signals will be broad-casted as long as they fulfill the Message protocol.

And the nice thing is that Portals are just Nodes themselves so no special treatment needed and all communication now really happens through messages and no host-level side-channels anymore. This is I think the best evidence that this model is more refined. One consequence is that all Node have to have a unique Address now since that's the only way to reach them.

So I spent the whole day turning Scopes into Portals, starting with the one manipulation Text. Since this required a bi-directional connection, I couldn't avoid cycles and had to do something about duplicated Signals. The simplest solution seemed a unique ID for each Signal so I did that. I struggled with this a bit since it seems overboard but then I thought in design-land this is a completely acceptable solution and this project is still very much living in design-land.

[2018-09-10T09:04] Thursday wad quite the busy day and I couldn't spend too much time with the prototype. 

### Digitalwerkstatt

Instead I had a coffee date with an old colleague in the morning after which I visited the [HABA Digitalwerkstatt], a private school for young children to learn programming and robotics. I loved the place from the moment I stepped through the door. It's a cross between Kindergarten and co-working space with small robots standing around. We had a great chat and I really hope I can get involved. Would love to get more experience how children best learn these concepts and maybe try some of my own didactic approaches. I'm also still very much considering targeting children as the first audience for zells. But that's still far in the future.

### Outreach and Donations

Talking about offices with great vibes: for lunch I met with a friend working at Mozilla. We also talked about zells a bit and he's the one who suggested starting a "Stammtisch" Meetup where I would just sit at a specific location regularly and see who comes by. We were talking about how to call it since ideally it should not only attract programmers but people from all kind of areas like education, linguistics, and others that I can't think of. But in the end my top candidate is still "Software Literacy".

He also suggested that should start start a project on [Patreon] and add a donation link through PayPal to the project website. I argued that there is currently no reason why anyone would donate to this project but he said "as long as they can't, they definitely won't" and I had to admit that he has a point.

### Send Message v2

The afternoon I spent on re-implementing the "Send Message" demo with the new model (Nodes & Channels). The most significant change is the role of Containers. Before, they were responsible for both structure as connection. Now connection is established with Channels so Containers are only about logical structure, basically name spaces. So a Container with the Address "foo" is told "the Node with the Address "bar" is now your inhabitant" and the Container then sends a Message to "bar", informing them about this circumstance. From that moment on, "bar"'s Address will be "foo/bar" or something like that.

There are still [some things to do][trello send message v2] before the demo works again but I hope I can show it on the next group seminar on Wednesday.
