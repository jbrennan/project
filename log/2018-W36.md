# 2018 Week 36

## 2018-09-03

[16:45] I started listening to [Steve's interview with Glen Chiacchieri][foc-26] on the morning train but only got far enough to know that I wanna hear the rest as well. For some reason, audio is far from my preferred format for this kind of content. It's too linear to navigate around in. The only option seems to be to listen to it from front to end, best without interruption since a recap via skimming is also not possible. But I still wanna know what they're saying. But it's a good activity for the commute.

Today I also started publishing my [notes] in the name of complete transparency. These are really pure stream-of-thought, way more than this log. Writing and drawing my ideas is just my way of working through something. For some reason, hand-writing my thoughts really helps me organizing them. It reached the point where I almost can't think about something without pen and paper - or the digital equivalent of it. I consider the destination more important than the journey but I guess I doesn't hurt to have the latter publicly accessible as well. So that's what these notes are.

And I wrote quite some amount today since a seemingly minor UI problem of not being able to attach two Scopes to the same Container turned out to be a symptom of a deeper problem with the model. So once again, I re-designed it from scratch. What I wanna change now is the way Zells are connected. Currently, the only way to do that is to arrange them in a tree structure using Containers. Instead, I want to try out connecting Zells with unidirectional "Channels" that don't imply structure, just a way to send a Signal from one Zell to another, in the resulting "Mesh". I hope that this will give me more flexible ways of building communication networks and separate the concerns of structure and communication. So I will probably re-do the [Send Message] demo with that new model once I implemented it.
