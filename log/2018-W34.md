# 2018 Week 31

The countdown has started. 89 days to. 13 weeks. November 18th seems far away now but will probably arrive faster than I think.

The goal of these 13 weeks is still a demo. But I'm not sure which demo. Currently, I consider the following options:

1. A *game* like Moonlander or Flappy Bird
2. A personal *data manager* or productivity like a ToDo list, a wedding planner, or time manager.
3. Implementing an *algorithm* Ã  la Victors [Binary Search] demo or other algorithms.

After talking with Marcel I think a game would be the better demo but an algorithm might be easier to achieve and having Victor's demo helps me a lot with visualization and direction. So I think I'll keep aiming for the "Binary Search" demo.

I thought about discussing the accidental complications in the group since I wanted to know if others think they are valid as well but after talking to some people here I guess that their validity is not the problem.

I seem to be stuck with the Manifesto. I want it to be concise and engaging as well as inspiring but I the words don't come out. Maybe try again later and work on something else in the meantime? I also want to publish the [list of accidental complications] that I extracted from the manifesto. That's the writing part.

And then there is the demo part. I read *[Sketching User Experiences]* during my vacation so now I'm eager to try my design wings. Tried to make a first sketch last week but only realized how hard designing is. Not sure how to share the sketches made in OneNote. Maybe I should use a file-based program for them. Will see what I find.

The rest of the day I unsuccessfully tried to do some sketches and eventually gave up. I thought maybe this use case is too big for me at the moment and that I should start with simpler ones. 

So I went back to the fundamentals and ended up thinking about the fundamentals and especially the model again. I was playing around with the concepts of Signals, Zells and Dishes and remembered the many times I thought Dishes should really also be Zells. This means though that there would be no semantical difference between transmitting and receiving a Signal which would make it hard to implement network-specific control mechanisms like routing and de-duplication. But the resulting model is quite neat. It consists of only two concepts: a *Signal*, which is simply a bit stream, and a *Zell*, which can receive a Signal. 

This could be formulated as

```
	Zell: receive(Signal: Bit*)
```

This reminded me of something that Marcel had said earlier. When I told about the demo options I was considering he said something like "in the end it's all just *data processing*". Computing is really just data and processing. The Signal is the data and the Zell is the processing. This model is a pure representation of the fundation of computing.

Also, this way a Zell is really just like a server, which can receive a bit stream. This way, each Zell can function as a peer in a network which is probably more powerful than having just the Dish being able to play that role. So it feels close to how Alan Kay described his idealistic model of computing.

This feels less like something I have discovered and more like something I have finally understood. It also feels less like a breakthrough and more like going in a circle. So I'm suspicious and need to let this simmer for a bit. And I need to find out who else used a similar description for computing and how the formailzed it.
