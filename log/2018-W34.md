# 2018 Week 34

## 2018-08-21

[11:31] 

The countdown has started. 89 days to. 13 weeks. November 18th seems far away now but will probably arrive faster than I think.

The goal of these 13 weeks is still a demo. But I'm not sure which demo. Currently, I consider the following options:

1. A *game* like Moonlander or Flappy Bird
2. A personal *data manager* or productivity like a ToDo list, a wedding planner, or time manager.
3. Implementing an *algorithm* Ã  la Victors [Binary Search] demo or other algorithms.

After talking with Marcel I think a game would be the better demo but an algorithm might be easier to achieve and having Victor's demo helps me a lot with visualization and direction. So I think I'll keep aiming for the "Binary Search" demo.

I thought about discussing the accidental complications in the group since I wanted to know if others think they are valid as well but after talking to some people here I guess that their validity is not the problem.

I seem to be stuck with the Manifesto. I want it to be concise and engaging as well as inspiring but I the words don't come out. Maybe try again later and work on something else in the meantime? I also want to publish the [list of accidental complications] that I extracted from the manifesto. That's the writing part.

And then there is the demo part. I read *[Sketching User Experiences]* during my vacation so now I'm eager to try my design wings. Tried to make a first sketch last week but only realized how hard designing is. Not sure how to share the sketches made in OneNote. Maybe I should use a file-based program for them. Will see what I find.

[20:08]

The rest of the day I unsuccessfully tried to do some sketches and eventually gave up. I thought maybe this use case is too big for me at the moment and that I should start with simpler ones. 

So I went back to the fundamentals and ended up thinking about the fundamentals and especially the model again. I was playing around with the concepts of Signals, Zells and Dishes and remembered the many times I thought Dishes should really also be Zells. This means though that there would be no semantical difference between transmitting and receiving a Signal which would make it hard to implement network-specific control mechanisms like routing and de-duplication. But the resulting model is quite neat. It consists of only two concepts: a *Signal*, which is simply a bit stream, and a *Zell*, which can receive a Signal. 

This could be formulated as

```
	Zell: receive(Signal: Bit*)
```

This reminded me of something that Marcel had said earlier. When I told about the demo options I was considering he said something like "in the end it's all just *data processing*". Computing is really just data and processing. The Signal is the data and the Zell is the processing. This model is a pure representation of the foundation of computing.

Also, this way a Zell is really just like a server, which can receive a bit stream. This way, each Zell can function as a peer in a network which is probably more powerful than having just the Dish being able to play that role. So it feels close to how Alan Kay described his idealistic model of computing.

This feels less like something I have discovered and more like something I have finally understood. It also feels less like a breakthrough and more like going in a circle. So I'm suspicious and need to let this simmer for a bit. And I need to find out who else used a similar description for computing and how the formalized it.

Got a late start today because of support work for my freelance project.

### Goals for today

- work through current reading list
- re-work "Transfer Signal" use case with new model
- write super rough draft of manifesto based on new structure

Considering the little time I have, I probably won't get to the manifesto.

### Group Seminar presentation

[14:34]

Fabio presented his work on porting Squeak to Truffle and running it on the GraalVM. It was very interesting to watch but it mostly made me realized how little I understand about VMs, byte codes, compiling and all of that stuff. Probably a hill I'll have to climb some day. Performance considerations is a topic I successfully manage to avoid but somewhere deep I'm very worried that in the end, it will be the wall this project crashes against.

### Reading list

Steve's link in the [Slack group] to [shalabh.com] spawned a medium-sized reading list of blogs and articles. I already dug into it on the train here and will read some more on the way back as well.

It's really inspiring but also humbling to keep finding people discontent with computing and projects in this area. Especially [SomethingNew] looks very interesting and I should get in touch with them soon. There is a huge overlap between the listed [Concepts] and design principles on zells.

I continue to be amazed by the many different approaches that I find. I haven't yet seen a project that uses the same approach as zells in spite the very similar motivations and outlooks.

### Dish-less model

I'm working through the implications of ditching Dishes from the model by re-doing the "Transfer Signal" use case. For the prototype I won't use actually bit streams but objects that are close to it like numbers, strings, lists and dictionaries. But I realized that even in a single-machine scenario I will have to de-duplicate Signals since if two Zells live in the same space, one can only send a Signal to its neighbors by sending it to its space which will forward it to all its inhabitants, including the sender. This gets worse with nested spaces.

As a probably naive approach, I'll use unique timed-out identifiers for de-duplication. This is probably quite a heavy performance penalty but I stick to my determination of staying as long as possible in design space where puny constraints like time and space don't matter.

Maybe some explanations regarding terminology are needed at this point: *spaces* are Zells that can contain other Zells, which are *inhabitants* of the space and *neighbors* of each other.

This model does seem to change the interaction model quite a bit. In the [current implementation][demo], a Signal is sent to all Zells in a Dish by dropping a Zell on the Dish which also puts it on the Dish. With the new model, dropping something on a Zell should make it receive that something or a part of it as a Signal. But what should then happen to the thing you dropped? Should it jump back to where you picked it up? Back into the hand? Or should it even be deleted?

An almost identical problem is described in [Designing the Xerox "Star" user interface][star]: a document dropped on the printer should be printed, but what should happen to the document afterwards?

> A question that has defied consensus in Star is what should happen to a document after it has been printed. Recall that a user prints a document by selecting its icon, invoking MOVE, and designating a printer icon. The printer absorbs the document, queuing it for printing. What happens to that document icon after printing is completed? The two plausible alternatives are:
> 1. The system deletes the icon.
> 2. The system does not delete the icon, which leads to several further alternatives:
>   a. The system puts the icon back where it came from (i.e., where it was before MOVE was invoked).
>   b. The system puts the icon at an arbitrary spot on the Desktop.
>   c. The system leaves the icon in the printer. You must move it out of the printer explicitly.

Not sure which solution I should go with. Maybe that's something that can be resolved through user testing.

87 days to go. Still have manifesto and new model on the agenda. Manifesto is something I can actually finish while the Dish-less model might have bigger implications on the whole project. I think really have to tackle both in parallel. So I'll do manifesto in the morning and modeling in the afternoon. Let's see how that goes.

[17:09]

Another day gone by more quickly than I prefer. I gave the manifesto revision another go but gave up pretty quickly. Don't know why I struggle so much with the words these days.

### Reading

So instead I skimmed through all articles on eighty-twenty.org, bookmarked about a dozen and read some of them. So far the most interesting to me are [Midnight Inspiration] and a [comparison between Smalltalk and Erlang]. Rich source of thought. Still have a couple of articles plus a PhD thesis to go.

[Midnight Inspiration]: https://eighty-twenty.org/2004/09/16/midnight-inspiration
[comparison between Smalltalk and Erlang]: https://eighty-twenty.org/2011/05/08/weaknesses-of-smalltalk-strengths-of-erlang

### Modeling

Afterwards I spent about 3 hours on figuring out how to adapt the prototype to the new model. Tried out SketchBook to make a rough [sketch] of the graphical user interaction in the hope that it's easier than with InkScape. Definitely looks sketchier. 

Got side-tracked by thought about the whole model of graphical user interaction. To me, a mouse of touchscreen is really a stick that you can use to poke and push sheets on a flat ground. So I again thought how nice it would be to be able to exchange the stick with different tools like a grabber or a pencil but then realized that as long as I'm building things in the host system, none of this matters.

And once I had figured out the interaction design, it was quite easy to [implement]. In the end, I decided to use a Scope to send a Signal to a Zell. The Scope can then act as a container for the dropped Zell which solves the problem with what to do with it nicely and is more uniform since everything is done via Scopes.

I demoed the result to Marcel and he suggested to present the model in Smalltalk first before jumping to the graphical interaction. So I added a Scope that prints to the Transcript but also has its own body to make the transition between the textual and the graphical interfaces smoother. Again, this was surprisingly easy. Programming in Squeak is an extremely pleasant experience.

### Next steps

All in all I feel pretty good about today. Manifesto still needs to be written. But maybe I just wait until inspiration strikes. Otherwise I still want to contact SomethingNew, so maybe that's something for tomorrow. And I want to record a new demo with the current prototype. Once that's done I'll probably start working on the next use case "Send Message", which is hopefully interesting enough to demo it to the group. If I do it without Message Discovery I might even get done until Wednesday. Let's see.
