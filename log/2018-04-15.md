So reading (at least certain kinds of material) before going to bed is sometimes not a good idea. Have been tossing and turning all night and decided that maybe writign down some thoughts might help.

### Future of Coding

I discovered [Future of Coding](http://futureofcoding.org/) the other day on [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16736913) the other day and thought it would be a good idea to read a bit through its  [log](http://futureofcoding.org/log). It turned out to be a little too interesting for a good night sleep.

Steve's approach to publishing his research log is a fantstic idea. I've been meaning to write a series of blog posts about some specific ideas lated to zells for years but I just never really fit it into my schedule, mostly because blog articles just take way to long. But I always write these stream-of-consciousness texts anyways when I want to think something through. So why not publish them? Probably means I can't do it on paper anymore though.


### Goal: Host project page

Before getting up I was thinking, that hosting the project website, including this log and everything else would be a very nice target for these three months of full-timing on zells. I would need a Web server, that translates specific URLs to rendering specific Zells, and updates the URLs during navigation. The user would download a JavaScript client and generate an identity on the first visit. I'm not entirely sure how navigation would be done. Clicking on a links would need to be translated into something like "render this Zell in my current display". Back and Forward buttons would step through the history of the display Zell. Only through the navigational points though, not every bit of scrolling and resizing. So links and the buttons really need to talk to the Display, not the project page. Wonder how to design this context-awarness. 

Maybe every visit would automatically fork the page and all navigation and interaction is then done on the fork. This will require some more thinking. But some interaction will require a fork anyways because it changes the content. Sorting the log for example.

But I still think it's a good goal because it requires so many higher-level parts of the system to be in place, which are not necessarely needed for the other goals like making a simple game:

- messages - basic message sending of course
- graphics - to draw the page's content
  - layout - so the content gets drawn nicely
  - text - because most will be text
  - drawing - because some will be simple drawings
- input - so the user can navigate and interact
- identities - so page visitors have an identity
  - access control - so not every visitor can change the content
  - resource permissions - to play sounds for example
  
  
### To be continued

Time to try to get some more shut-eye. This little entry took me 30 minutes. Should be nice to write here whenever I feel like it and maybe every day once I start the full-time period.
