# 2018 Week 48

### Proposal

Still working on my grant proposal and still astounded by how much work this requires. I had a first draft which I then completely restructured after reading "[A Rulebook for Arguments]" and chapter 5 of "[A Manual for Writers]". Reading the new attempt to a field-outsider confirmed that the structure is much better but my style is too complicated, probably because I'm trying to cram too many ideas into too few sentences. So next revision will focus on simplifying.

### Literature

I was distracted for almost a whole day by the fantastic contents of the [EduTech Wiki][edutech] of the University of Geneva. I found a ton of articles related to [Constructionism] and a bunch of new [similar projects]. The only problem is that this discovery added 15 papers to my reading list.

But I also removed two items from that list: [Michael Nielsen]'s notes on [Chalktalk] and [Magic Paper], including the full [talk by Ken Perlin][chalktalk talk] which was all very inspiring.

### Teaching and Teachers

I also had two half-days of teaching children programming which is still quite the challenge, especially with 24 children at a time. I am not learning as much about learning as I hoped, mainly because I'm not designing the classes myself, but I do learn a whole lot about teaching.

I also by lucky chance ended up at a [Freifunk] Berlin workshop for teacher who want to build a student network in their schools. I used the opportunity to talk to a couple of them about using simulations to teach science subjects and received very positive responses, including the agreeing to be interviewed by me. So scheduling and performing these interviews is now high on my list. First step to confirm some of my assumptions.

### Values and Principles

Inspired by [David Unger's talk][self talk], I also created a [document to collect values and principles][foundation] of this project. My goal is to strongly settle on some core values and deduct principles from them which I can use to guide design design decisions. The values I chose are: Curiosity, Creativity and Cooperation. I'm fairly set on these (they also align quite well with [Albert Wenger's world view][world after capital]) but am still struggling with the principles.
