Zells days are too rare and pass too quickly. Can't wait to really start with 100% zells. Hopefully beginning of July.

### Manifesto

But they are very enjoyable. Today I finally published the new and revised [manifesto]. I'm thinking about posting it on Hacker News again since when I posted it in 2016 I got quite some amazing feedback. Wanna hear what some of my colleagues are saying before doing that though.

### Notes from talking to Jens

After lunch I talked to Jens who is directly responsible for me being at the institute since his involvement with [Lively Kernel] is how I found out about this group.

First thing he said was that getting public funding is very difficult and that they already had a couple of projects that did not succeed. Sometimes it's easier but especially these days I shouldn't get my hopes up. What is easier in his experience is get funding from private companies. As I understood it, Lively was funded first by Sun Microsystems and then by SAP as part of the Communication Design Group (CDG) and the Human Advancement Research Center (HARC).

Also he estimated that about a third of the time of a researcher at the institute is spent on research. Another third is spent on teaching and the last on operational/administrative tasks.

His domain is End-User Programming and he wrote his dissertation "Evolving Tools in a Collaborative self-supporting Development Environment" on the Lively Web Werkstatt.

One goal for him is to create a development environment that he can use himself and other developers who appreciate the ability to adapt their environment. So the "end user" in this case is the developer. Building an environment for myself is also a strong motivation for me. He wrote parts of his dissertation inside Lively and others with markdown and realized how the "low tech" approach had its advantages so that's something his wants to integrate into Lively 4. Another thing he noticed while working on Lively is how seemingly less important things like layouting in a visual programming language can turn into an important and complex building block.

About the evolution of Lively:
- lively kernel: based on Morphic and SVG, supported by Sun and managed with SVN
- lively web: moved to git and supported by SAP
- lively next: more modular, influenced by functional programming
- lively 4: uses HTML instead of Morphic

The approach of Lively 4 is to more embrace existing standard like HTML, CSS and JavaScript and thus turn more into a tool which can be mixed-and matched. An important advantage is that technologies that are learned in this context can be used in other ones as well. And history showed that a clean-cut approach rarely reaches good adoption. This reminded me of Gabriel's "Worse is Better" concept. Jens said that he feels if something seems badly designed and a historical accident we are probably just lacking the proper perspective to understand why it is the why it is. Not sure if I can agree with that.

The last thing he said is that I should check out Entity Component System as a design strategy.

He also mentioned ContextJS which I yet need to check out.

### Prototype

The rest of the afternoon I worked on prototype eight. Had the Squeak VM crash on me twice but with my new super-useful shortcut I save the image often enough to get back on track quickly.

I started building the `TextScope` to show and edit the value of a simple `TextZell`. Also, it can collapse and expand and be resized. So very basic stuff. But it got me thinking about basic stuff like what a Signal is and how Scopes talk to Zells.

Decided that for this use case, a Signal is any basic values like strings, numbers, dictionaries and sets.

Eventually I want Scopes to use zells Messages to talk to Zells. But for now I'll use direct method calls. This means that I can point a Scope at a Zell without a name which wouldn't be possible if Messages are used since there would be now way to address the Message.

This got me thinking if Zell names should be case-sensitive. This should probably depend on the Zell. I don't want to restrict names to Unicode characters anyways. They should also be images or literally anything.

So in the end, every Zell that implements the Message protocol must have an address and therefore a name. But they don't have to implement a protocol to change their names, clone or destroy them. Those are separate protocols.

The only capability a Zell has to have is to receive a Signal. What it does with the Signal is completely up to itself. This remains the basic building block.

So I got some tiny UI element with very little functionality. But it's a progress. Got a taste of how darn long it will take me to get something interesting going.
