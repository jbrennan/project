Having notes is definitely very helpful for picking up where I left things two weeks ago. I still like [the plan] of using demos of use cases to drive the implementation of a prototype, while recording interesting aspects and ideas in video and text. The texts won't necessarily be scientific papers though although I would prefer them to be.

I want to be as [human-centered] as I can so building a community to test and iterate on my ideas will be very important. Not sure how to tackle that yet, though. So far, I have a couple of people I emailed with a couple of times, great people in the [Future of Programming Slack group] and my temporary colleagues at HPI. I'm also thinking of starting a "Stammtisch" to get to know more local people interested in these topics.

The goal is still [the same]: implementing something similar to the "[Binary Search]" demo fo [Bret Victor]. And since I want to create story boards and paper prototypes for each use case before I start implementing anything, so I can iterate on them using feedback from the community, I thought about starting with a story board for this use case. I'm not completely sure if that might not be too big a bite but even if, it might still be a good exercise to harden and find week points in the whole design.

I'm gonna give myself 13 weeks (starting 2018-08-20) to reach this goal and will then evaluate if I want to continue or not.

To organize my work, I started a [board] on Trello, and in the spirit of this exercise in transparency, made it public. The first thing I wanna do, probably until the 20th, is to extract the part about the accidental complication from the [Manifesto] and elaborate a little more on the other parts, as suggested by a friend of mine after an in-depth discussion about this document.
