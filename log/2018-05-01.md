Decided to skip the holiday and dedicate half the day to zells, first time since December. My todo list says "revise manifesto". So I guess I'll do that today. Alternatively I could also work on the camerata idea. A good first step would to ask a couple of potential members what they think about it. I'll put that on the list.

### Collaboration Space

I continues thinking about how a virtual camerata could be done. Trying to figure out what is missing with the virtual communities as they exist nowadays. Cause I feel like something is missing. But then again I never really participated in one. So maybe I'm wrong about this. But I'm missing that feeling that I have when I participate in a meetup or help organizing one. It could be purpose but it's also something physical.

My thoughts keep returning to the [CDG labs research agenda][poster], especially the *Research Gallery* part. Unfortunately, Victor didn't talk about that part in his [talk], but to me it's the most fascinating aspect. Especially because it's pretty independent of the *dynamic medium*. All research spaces I know usually do a poor job in displaying the past and ongoing work, even statically. And I also think about work spaces, like offices. In the offices I know, there is almost no visibility into what everybody is working on. There is no casual browsing and skimming. Usually there is little more than a couple of Github repositories and maybe something like a Kanban board. Neither is very well suited for browsing.

So I wonder if visibility and browsability could improve collaboration. I'm thinking of workshops, and I think that's also a big part behind the design of Dynamic land. Projects are literally lying around on the tables. Not just it's documentation, but the actual work. So it's easy by just walking through the room to see what everybody is working on. You don't need to read tickets, issues, cards or *readme*s. It's just *obvious*.

I'm pretty sure the physicality is important to Victor, but I'm always thinking about virtual space when I see his visions. Physical space unites but it also divides. The most common comment [Hacker News] seems to be that you can't see what's going on there without travelling to California.

How could this be translated to a virtual space? One that independent of physical locations and even better also of timezones.

It should probably be an actual *space*, meaning at least 2-dimensional. The way I see it, books and websites are 1-dimensional. You can jump between parts, but only back and forth. This does make navigation easier but also limits it. So I'm thinking of a 2D virtual space, basically a virtual desk. But a very large one. Practically infinite. And infinitely scalable, too. This would already allow different levels of detail, depending on your "distance" to an object. And just like in Dynamicland, everything would be executing right there and then. No need to download, build and run it. Just looking at it would be enough to get an impression of what something is about. But since it's dynamic and virtual, it would also be easy to tinker around with something, changing some things and seeing what happens. Everything can be forked, merged and reverted.

This is my perspective through my *zells glasses* of course. But I like the idea. Basically a virtual 2D Dynamicland.

Time to call it a day. Watched two TED talk of Tim Berners-Lee, calling for *Linked Data* and a *Magna Carta* for the Web's 25th anniversary. Wonder if there is more data available now than in 2009 but looking at the *Open Data* initiatives in Berlin and Germany, it seems like it to me. I couldn't find what happened to the *Magna Carta* though. [webat25.com](https://www.w3.org/webat25/) doesn't seem to have been updated since May 2015.

Otherwise, I mostly worked on revising the manifesto today. I'm quite unhappy with the current version which annoys me since I already revised it twice. Well, third time's a charm.

I wanna improve the introduction part and most importantly use a single, better example for the benefits and the complications. Probably a coffee shop owner that wants to improve throughput. I also wanna switch the order and describe the complications before describing the benefits. Maybe I'll get to it some time this week.
