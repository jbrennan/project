It's July and I'm still not full-time on zells. But I decided that I won't stress myself and take my time finishing my current project and make sure that I do a good job. Until then I'll spend one day per week in Potsdam and only then will my three months of zells start.


### Prototype Eight: First Use Case implemented

I have implemented all I need to demo the first use case: [Transmit Signal]. I'm actually a bit surprised since I thought the rest would take me all day. So now I can start thinking about how I'll record the demo. Exciting! Although the demo itself will probably be pretty boring. It's a small first step.

### Squeak UI Paper [15:18]

The rest of the day I was listening to presentations and reading a [paper Marcel sent me][squeak shell] about hwo to implement a new UI in Squeak. It's an excellent deep dive into the UI and application libraries of Squeak, which was so far a bit of a black box for me.


### Next week

Although I reached a milestone with the prototype, I feel a bit lost today and like I am jumping around too much between topics. So I want to think a bit about a plan for next week. The thing that I'm avoiding to do is to research how to write a proposal. I don't even know how to start this one nor if a proposal is really what I want to get out of these months. Definitely need to think about that. What else? I could also focus on documentation next week. I have a list of similar projects which really needs some notes. And I wanted to create a list of people. I also wanted to list text and video that align with my vision of Computer Literacy. I think that would be a good outcome of next week's zells day. Today I'll wrap up slightly early.
