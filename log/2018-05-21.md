### HPI Visit

Last week I visited the [Software Architecture Group][SWA] at the Hasso Plattner Institute to talk about how I could possibly turn this project into a research project, something we've been more or less talking about since end of 2016. But this time it was a little bit more concrete since I am planning to work on it full-time this summer. My hopes are that I we can together we can send in a proposal to fund a PhD position, which would be my absolute dream so I'm careful to manage my expectations.

But any kind of collaboration or just co-location with this group would be amazing for me, since I enjoyed every single one of my visits - since I found them through the [Lively] project. Talking to the people of the group always left me with renewed motivation and inspiration, but also the feeling that I'm just at the start of a very long path.

So I'm quite excited that so far it looks like starting June, I'll be actually able to work in the group as a visiting researcher.


### Research Topics

One feedback I got from my talk last week was that I definitely need to do tons of reading to familiarize myself with existing research in the area that I want to work in, since I cannot simply go about claiming that I want to make everything better without being able to thouroughly justify it.

So I've been thinking about what topics might be suitable for research and came up with the following:

- *Abstraction by Forking*: An object model where new objects are always created by forking existing objects, and changes of the parent object can be merged into the child.

- *Always Debugging*: A programming environment that forces you to always create an example input for every functional unit that is created. Editing always happens in the live context (debugging mode) of one example, so you can always see and analyse the execution.

- *Exploring Protocols through Conversation*: A way of discovering and exploring protocols of systems, by dynamic queries instead of parsing a static protocol description. Queries use example messages and include questions like "What messages do you understand?", "Is this a message you would understand?" and "What would happen if I sent you this message?"

- *Broadcasting Messages*: An interaction model based on message-passing that uses only broadcasting to deliver messages.

- *Pure Asynchrony*: A programming model without any synchronous computation.

- *Self Representation*: A distributed software system (think Web) where every object bundles everything that makes it useful, i.e. to draw itself, interpret input, and so on. Opposite of "Separation of content and presentation".

I realize I know very little about them but maybe I can manage to learn enough about each in a couple of weeks to decide which one would be a good candidate for a research topic.


### Academia vs. Industry

I recently came across [Bret Victor's collection of references][refs] and read "The Computers Nobody Wanted - My Years with Xerox" by Paul Strassmann and it was really interesting to see the counter perspective on PARC and why the company did not make better use of their inventions.

The picture that I got is that Xerox executives hoped that they would get something out of the reserach facility that they could easily turn into a very profitable product. But the only thing that the reserachers were interested in was to advance their field, and there was little done to align the two. Most of PARC's inventions were 10-15 ahead of their time, which makes very difficult to sell, since there was no market yet. Especially not for a personal computer that costs the yearly salary of its user. Xerox seemed unwilling to put the required engineering and marketing effort in to turn it an affordable product. Something that Apple achieved.

It seems like Xerox had the resources to develop the technology for the next century but not the vision or audacity to market it. I can imagine that this is a pretty common dilemma for companies of similar size.

This topic also reminded me of my first impressions of Squeak and Etoys. I always felt that they appeared to lack quite a bit of design regarding usability and aesthetics, compared to Pharo and Scratch for example. This might be a fundamental dichotomy between industry and academia. One aims to create something that people can and want to use, the other to create and archive new knowledge, independent of its usability. Can there be a symbiosis?


### Prototype Roadmap

I've been thinking the last couple of days about how I can build an environment in which I can create, execute and analyse dynamic models without having to build the whole environment. It seemed like a chicken-egg problem but I think I can use a host system like Squeak to build authoring and analysis tools that only require an implementation of the underlying object and interaction models. This way, I would couple myself to the host environment but it would allow me to experiment with any of the above mentioned research topics without having to build the entire stack.


### Manifesto Revision

Seems like I've spent an hour writing this log. That only gives me another hour to continue my revision of the manifesto. The current [draft] is pretty much complete but requires heavy revision. It seems especially hard for me to find the sweetspot between too dry and too juicy. Currently I'm definitely on the too juicy side. But I like that I was able to bind almost all points into a single, plausible example. Let's see if I can improve it a bit.
