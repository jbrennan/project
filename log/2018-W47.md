# 2018 Week 47

Finally caught up with my journal entries which I have been neglecting for almost four weeks. And I immediately broke my resolution of being more disciplined since it's already Monday.

Most of my time this week I spent working on the proposal with which I want to apply for a research grant. I wanted to have draft done by Friday but I didn't get further than collecting its elements without any order. What took a lot of time was searching for evidence supporting my claims like "building and analyzing models is a better way of learning sciences". This was especially annoying since I didn't find anything that I could (or knew how to) use. But Marcel could give me a couple of pointers after I showed him what I got. First and foremost books on how to structure scientific publications and argumentative essays.

I also spent quite a bit of time on searching for foundations and ended up with a list of about three dozen which was a positive surprise. So the next step is to find a handful that I want to apply for. Not sure yet how to filter them though.

And I reached out to [Jason Brennan] who is developing [a project][beach] which seems extremely close to what my goal is with zells. I found him (like many other interesting people) through [Steve's podcast][foc20] and spent about half a day going through all of his public output I could find, including some of his [work at Khan Academy][mathland].
