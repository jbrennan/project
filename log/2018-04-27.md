I'm pretty happy with the progress in my freelance project this week so I decided to dedicate the rest of this Friday to zells.

My current plan is to work full-time on it for a couple of months starting June. I'll meet with Marcel and Robert in three weeks to talk about whether we could use that time to work on a DFG proposal. I don't even dream of the proposal to be granted but just working at the SWA group for a couple of weeks would already be fantastic. So I'm quite excited about that meeting.

But I'm not really sure what to do with those two hours today. Wrote a README for the [project repository]. Spend some time during the last week going through the resources that I got from Steve. One new project I found was [isomorf]. Added it to the list. Maybe moving documents into the repository would be something I could do now. Let's do that.
