I'm pretty happy with the progress in my freelance project this week so I decided to dedicate the rest of this Friday to zells.

My current plan is to work full-time on it for a couple of months starting June. I'll meet with Marcel and Robert in three weeks to talk about whether we could use that time to work on a DFG proposal. I don't even dream of the proposal to be granted but just working at the SWA group for a couple of weeks would already be fantastic. So I'm quite excited about that meeting.

But I'm not really sure what to do with those two hours today. Wrote a README for the [project repository]. Spend some time during the last week going through the resources that I got from Steve. One new project I found was [isomorf]. Added it to the list. Maybe moving documents into the repository would be something I could do now. Let's do that.

I moved my lists of [conferences] and [similar projects] into the [project repository]. This already made me revise these lists and add to them. So a positive result. Maybe I'll publish more of my existing notes here as well but for now I want to focus on the future. I also thought about publishing my list of people but many of the are personal contacts so I think I'll have to sort them through a bit first.

I just read through the [research agenda of the Communications Design Group][poster] by Bret Victor. Very inspirational stuff. If I'm ever in need of some inspiration, this is the document I need to open. All of these ideas probably need some really good VR technology. Especially spscial arrangements are very much under-used in current software. One thing I wanna leverage in zells. I'm thinking about a uge canvas where you can place any objects, that change their representation depending on how much you have zoomed-in on them. So navigation would feel more like Google Earth. This would already be useful on a flat display but even more so in a 3D virtual environment.

Another thing that I can't stop thinking about is the [Camarata idea]. I would love to be part of a group like that. One to exchange ideas and comments and work on projects together. But all the online groups I found so far lack activity and also focus. And then I was thinking: what if I made that a use case for zells? I want it to be highly collaborative. So it could be a good platform for a virtual group like this. What capabilities would I need to make enable this? Is this even a good use case? It would be great for dog-fooding.

How would I try to build a Camerata? It would need a common problem. I still think "How can we enable a general Software Literacy?" is a pretty good start. And it would probably be a curated group with invitation-only access and some sort of introduction of new members. And it's important that members can intetact in-person or at least through synchronous audio/video. So real-life events would definitely be needed. Tricky with international members. Maybe virtual events would also work. It would also be great if there were rooms where members could "bump into" each other for casual conversations. Early interactions probably need to be hand-crafted/facilitated and content be frequently created to keep people interested.

This would definitely require a lot of effort and persistence. I wonder if it's a good time to do that. And I wonder how much it would take. But maybe that's something worthwhile working on.
