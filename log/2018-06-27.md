Today I only did half a day because I didn't want to miss BBQ and watching Germany against Korea. And the meat at least was excellent.


## Manifesto

I finally merged the new version of the [manifesto] and am currently quite happy with it. Let's see how long this sentiment will last. I want to post it on Hacker News since I got excellent feeback when I posted the first version. But before that I want to do a couple of more iteration with the help of friends.

[Steve Krouse's][foc] feedback was overall psitive. He did remark though that's it's very similar to Chris Granger's [Coding is not the new literacy][chris]. This and also Paul Chuisano's essay on [The Future of Software][paul] certainly had a strong influence on me. He also recommended [No Silver Bullet] and [Out of the Tar Pit] so I started with reading the latter.


## Out of the Tar Pit

Especially the first half of the paper was a very exciting read for me, since the topics of "how to control complexity", "how to specify a system" and "functional vs. object-oriented programming" are exactly where my interests currently are. Especially the last topic troubles me since I'm aware that I have a strong bias towards OOP but also see many recent projects that aim to facilitate software development opt for a functional approach. I am very unsure if my bias is well-founded and suspect a giant blind spot somewhere in that direction. So having a very well written argument for the FP side was a great help for me to clarify my own thoughts.

#### Specification by Example

During the last couple of years, I've been exploring how to leverage example to specify and test a system, which is also known as [Behavior-Driven Development] or [Specification by Example]. For me this is currently one of the best tools in my box to manage complexity. One reason is, that with a near-perfect test coverage, I can be very sure, that any change I make does not change the relevant behavior of the system, so I can freely redesign its implementation to increase simplicity. Another reason is that having an example ready and executable for every scenario that occurred to me or my colleagues, frees me from having to "play compiler" why I work on the system. If I'm not sure what exactly a piece of code does, I step through an examplar execution with the debugger. If I'm not sure why a certain line of code exists, I delete it and see which test fails. If no test fails, I dig further and ultimately get rid of the line if it's not needed.

In Out of the Tar Pit, the authors argue that "testing cannot be enough to understand a system or proof its correctness", since "behavior in one state tells you nothing about the behavior in any other state". I think this very much depends on how you define "understand" and "proof of correctness". If the former one means "to be able to predict the system's behavior in every possible situation" and the latter "to mathematically proof certainty of a desired outcome for every possible scenario", then tests won't do you much good. But if understanding means "to know how a system behaves in all relevant situations" and the correctness that "a system exhibits expected behavior in all relevant situations", then automated tests are very much enough to reach either.

And it's not even that black-and-white. I feel like there is a whole spectrum between the description of a single state transition and *all* state transistions. While for software on board of an airplane, you definitely should demand a formal proof of your system's behavior, for most systems this is overkill. And there is plenty of room in between the two extremes for generating ranges of input or permutating order of concurrent processes. For me it's a continuum from the total concrete to the total abstract.

#### Complexity through Control

I have never considered control mechanisms to cause accidental complexity but it's not a coincidence that I've added *Pure Asynchrony* to my [list of research topics]. The authors argue that "languages with implicit order force to overspecify" and I was very happy to finally have words to describe this vague feeling of mine. A mentioned programming language without implicit control is [Oz] which I yet have to check out.

#### Understanding Software

I did not manage to really define what I mean with *accidental complication* in the manifesto, and didn't dare to use "complications that wouldn't exist in an *ideal* world" as a definition since that only puts the burden on what this *ideal* world exactly looks like. But at least I'm fairly sure about what I mean by *complication*: something that makes it hard to reach your goal. Parallel to this, the paper defines complexity as something that makes it hard to *understand* a piece of software. 

And *understanding* just happens to be one of complications from the [manifesto]. So complexity is a complication I guess. But there are other ways to improve understanding, for example what Donald Knuth called [Literate Programming][knuth], which Eve came very close to at some point. Here again it feels to me like avoiding complexity at all costs is too much of a burden, especially for a non-professional programmer. Instead, I want to explore approaches that enables the programmer to reduce complexity and lay paths through it. But I have no idea how to really do that yet.


## Boxer

I also managed to read one paper from my list of recommendations for HPI researchers. This one is called "Boxer: a Reconstructible Computational Medium" and contrary to my initial believe, "Boxer" is not the name of the author, but of the project the paper is presenting. The name comes from the main structural element of the environment, which are nested boxes. The overall approach is very similar to what I'm going for and I hope I'll write a more extensive analysis of the paper at another point. For now it's added to my list of [similar projects].


## Follow-up with Jens

I also had a follow-up conversation with Jens since I didn't manage to ask him about his advice for me the last time. He asked me what I want to achieve during my time as visitng researcher which is a) an overview over the field and b) a demo of part of my vision. He agreed that a demo is important but that I should try to make it as rough as possible to get feedback as quickly as possible. He recommended two projects with excellent demos to me. One is a projection editor for Squeak methods and the other a master thesis on "Babylonian Programming" which sounded very similar to programming by example. Regarding what use case I should use for the demo he suggested to re-create a demo of Bret Victor which was also the origin of the editor project.

Regarding my selection of possible research topics he remarked that these would all be possible but that they seem rather unrelated to him.

And lastly regarding funding: a proposal for a PhD position is not completely hopeless in his opinion but would require extensive research on my site to familiarize myself with the formal and less formal requirements. The actual research topic will be the easier part. I wonder if it's worth investing that much effort if the chances of success are pretty low. But what other ways are there?


## Prototype

I worked on simplifying the [first use case] even more and unifying the user interaction model. I was struggling with how to represent Zells, basic structural and computational element. One goal is that Zells represent themselves but for simplicity reasons I want to stay away from graphics until more complex use cases. 

So instead I'm using `Scopes` which you can `pointAt: aZell` to interact with it. The Scope decides if it can target a certain Zell by probing if it implements a certain protocol. So for example you can point a `TextScope` at a `NumberZell`, because it supports the Messages `changeValue:` and `onValueChanged:`, but you cannot point a `NumberScope` at a `TextZell` because it does not understand the messasge `numberValue`.

So in a way Zells are like files and folders and Scopes are like applications you can "open" them with. The major difference is that unlike files, Zells are running processes so in order to interact with one, you don't have to implement its entire protocol (ie parse the file) but only the subset you're interested in. But in order to "look at" a given Zell you will need some sort of repository that you can query for matching Scopes.

A very general Scope is the `InspectorScope` which can be pointed at any container and visualizes the Zells contained by it on which you can point other Scopes. So in the analogy it's a file browser. The only difference here is that each file draws its own icon.

Describing these things in words seems unadequate but I don't have a better medium yet so it'll have to do. I filed-out the [current version] into the [prototype eight repository][repo] and will record a demo once I have something interesting enough to show. Rather sooner than later though. My plan is to record many small demos instead of one big one. Let's see how that works out.
