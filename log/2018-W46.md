# 2018 Week 46

[2018-11-19] Last week I finally defeated my motivational problems. Still not sure where they come from. But it might be that "describing the system" is a lot harder to motivate for than simply "building the system". Probably because the latter gives me more short-term rewards. But I couldn't build something interesting in over two months so now it's time to try a different approach.

So the first half of the week I spent on introspection and finishing "A Small Matter of Programming". It was really hard to believe that it was written 25 years ago. In all this time, not much seems to have happened in this area. Still not sure how to share my notes on what I read.

## Values

I also watched a very inspiring talk by David Unger titled "[Self and Self: Whys and Wherefores][self talk]" in which he doesn't only talk about the language but also its circumstances and gives some meta-advice. For example to be aware of the "fallacy of example-driven design" which might lead to an over-fitted design. Instead, he suggests to identify values and infer principles from them which in turn guide design decisions and practices and to "know why for each design choice", instead of just copying what is popular or familiar.

So here is my first shot at values:
- curiosity - learning ideas and discovering new ones
- creativity - contributing your own ideas
- cooperation - sharing and building on each others' ideas

It's not a coincidence that these value are very well aligned with the most important thesis from [World After Capital]: 

> The Knowledge Loop, which consists of learning, creating and sharing, is the source of all knowledge. Producing more knowledge is essential to human progress. The history of humanity is filled with prior civilizations that failed to produce the knowledge required to overcome the challenges they faced. [...] Knowledge is what makes us humans human.

If I may get a bit philosophical for a moment: I'm very much convinced that "to create knowledge" is an excellent answer to "what's the point of it all?" aka "what's the meaning of life?". Or even more extreme: Knowledge is the only thing that counts anything hence all activity should be judged by how much it contributes to knowledge.

My goal is general Software Literacy because I'm convinced that it will improve the knowledge loop.

## Research Question

I'm still struggling with finding out what problem I actually want to solve. A realized that a direction like "Abstraction would be easier to understand if you can go from concrete to abstract (i.e. group instances into classes instead of creating them from classes)" would not be very interesting to me. I understand that I need to narrow down my problem space but this is just too narrow for my taste.

So my new idea for a problem is: there is currently no platform for building arbitrarily complex models of dynamic processes (high ceiling) that is accessible to young students  (low floor) and usable in an educational context.

Sounds like I want to build a better Scratch. Probably a tough sell. But an honest one.
