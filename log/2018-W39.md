# 2018 Week 39


## 2018-09-24

[2018-09-25T13:52] Must be the first time I forgot to write the log at the end of the day. I did finish most of the [implementation tasks][trello 48] for the "3+4" use case. I changed the visual design of the MessageEditor and the TransceiverPortal and in the end I could actually construct a Message to ask for the sum of 3 and 4 and receive the answer.

But something felt off and I couldn't put my finger on it so I [wrote down my thoughts][20180924 notes] in hope for clarity, which I didn't achieve. My only clue was that the editor made Message look and feel much more complicated than I imagined it would. I always hoped the presentation wouldn't be too different from writing "3 + 4" but it was miles away from that. And I had to leave it at that for the day.

[14:02] I slept a lot better than I was afraid I would with that unsolved puzzle of yesterday. But I said even before doing my morning routing to [write down my thoughts][20180925 notes] and try to figure out where the bad feeling came from.

### Editors and Portals

My conclusion for now is that I tried to squeeze too much into the MessageEditor. It's displaying and editing the structure, as well as the values. And it's doing all of this as an interpreter of the Message. So I broke my own principle of not interpreting data and instead let the data represent itself.

So I want to use Portals more for this, which means that each part of a Message would be properly deserialized into a Node that can draw itself and react to input. Since I don't have a proto Node yet I will probably sacrifice serializability and use Smalltalk classes for that. So a Message draws itself in a certain way and even Addresses choose their own presentation. In the case of a NumberAddress, this would be simply the number's symbol.

So that's the DisplayPortal (or maybe ScreenPortal) which lets the Nodes draw themselves. But you can also point a ContainerPortal at a Node which will give you a tree view of the Container, its Parts and their Parts and you can change that structure and probably the Names of the Nodes. And there is also an AddressPortal that lets you edit an Address and even a NumberAddressPortal which lets you change the number with buttons and a dial so I can use my NumberEditor again which makes me happy for some reason.

I like this idea and wanna try out to have multiple views on the same Nodes, some more for displaying and some more for editing. This would dial down a bit on the whole direct manipulation approach but I think that's ok for now.

### Nodes, Meshes and Messages (again)

Thinking about how Portals give you different capabilities to display and manipulate a Node, I also started thinking about the whole model of Nodes and Signals and Meshes and Messages. Currently everything is modelled with a class hierarchy with a normal Node on top and each Node below adding some capability like having an Address or being able to open Channels.

But I thought instead of a hiarcharchy the different capabilities should be more pluggable. A Node is still the most basic element and can only receive Signals which are bit streams. But if you want to connect it to a Mesh you need to be able to open a Channel to a Node on the Mesh and follow the Mesh protocol of structured Signals with ID and payload (aka Message). Next the Node needs to understand Messages with Addresses and if you want to put it into a Container it also needs to know how to become part of one.

So most of these things are really just protocols and although the build on each other, I want to find a way to model this in a less hierarchical way. Not sure if that can be easily done in Smalltalk though.

### First things first

After thinking about all of these plans I realized that I lost a bit of focus. So I decided to still record a demo of the "3+4" use case with the current implementation, even though the UI is pretty terrible. For one as a documentation of the current state but also because it still shows how I imagine interaction with the system to be even with the suboptimal UI.

So I fleshed out what the Messages would be and made the Transceiver scrollable. Now I only need to make "numbers" react as specified and then I should be able to record something.
