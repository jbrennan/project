	<h1>Comparison of existing platforms</h1>

	<p>The goal of <em>zells</em> is to enable Software Literacy by providing a software platform without the incidental complications found in current platforms. The [manifesto] describes these complications in details, although in a rather abstract manner. The purpose of this document is to look at a selection of current platforms more closely and how certain complications materialize in them.</p>

	<p>Restricted by my own knowledge, the list of platforms is all but complete and not every complication is discussed for every platform. If you find something missing, wrong or imprecise, please <a href="https://github.com/zells/core/edit/master/comparison.html">help improving this document</a>. Any form of contribution or feedback will be appreciated.</p>

	<p>For an up-to-date list and descriptions of identified complications and how they are avoided in <em>zells</em>, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/zells/core/blob/master/manifesto.md">manifesto</a>.</p>


	<h2>Platforms</h2>

	<p>This list contains a variety of software products and protocols which I all consider to be <em>platforms</em>, since they allow users to create, run and share their own software.</p>

	<p>The categories are <em>protocols</em> for platforms that are defined by standards rather than an implementation, <em>operating systems</em> for everything which is located directly between user and hardware, <em>virtual machines</em> for things that could be called programming languages and everything else is considered an <em>application</em>.</p>

	<p>The lines between these categories are fluent since it could be argued that some virtual machines behave like operating systems or have well defined protocols and some applications behave like virtual machines.</p>
